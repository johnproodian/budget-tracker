# Budget Tracker
This app allows a user to track personal transactions. Each transaction is added to the table and the graph below tracking income and expense over time (or, more precisely, over number of transactions) is adjusted.

The purpose of this project was to make this app functional offline, using indexedDB and service workers, and to convert it to a PWA.

## Built With
* JavaScript
* MongoDB
